# week3project

The problem domain we hope to focus on during this project is recipe organization. There is a great deal of preparation and effort that goes into making a meal, one of the hardest being finding an adequate recipe to match one's lifestyle, dietary preferences, and available ingredients to name a few. Even bypassing this, one may be overwhelmed by the surplus of existing recipes and struggle to find one to fit the given circumstance. This lack of organization can easily lead to stress and frustration, leaving individuals avoidant of cooking in the future. By tackling this domain, we would like to create a categorized digital storage space for various recipes that can be discovered, browsed or added in order to help individuals create tasteful dishes consistently and efficiently without the added tension.

Our application will allow users to browse different recipes that are posted by other users and upload recipes of their own. Users will be able to search based on specific characteristics of recipes (ex. gluten free, vegan) to make discovering recipes that fit their needs easier.
